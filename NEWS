*The 'HoRM' package is officially launched.  This package is a supplement for the book "Handbook of Regression Methods" by Derek S. Young.  It is also used with the Shiny app for the book located at https://shiny.as.uky.edu/HoRM/.  It is not anticipated that the HoRM package will be updated very much.   New versions of the package will be released only if there are updates made to the Shiny app or compatibility issues arise.
